                <p>
                    After Gate was born from a passion to create the most immersive and expansive real-time strategy space war game ever conceived. We envisioned a game where players could truly lose themselves in a vast galactic conflict spanning over 100 unique planets, each with its own strategic significance and visual identity. Our goal is to blend deep strategic gameplay with rich narrative storytelling, creating an experience that keeps players engaged for months. This isn't just a game - it's a living, breathing universe where your decisions have lasting consequences across multiple interconnected storylines. We're building After Gate to be the ultimate RTS experience that combines the tactical depth veterans crave with the epic scope and character-driven narratives that make gaming truly unforgettable.

After Gate is a real-time strategy game where you'll command fleets, manage resources, and engage in tactical combat across over 100 unique planets. Begin by selecting your faction and starting planet, each offering different strategic advantages. You'll need to balance economic development with military expansion while navigating complex diplomatic relationships. The tutorial campaign will introduce you to core mechanics including resource gathering, unit production, technology research, and combat tactics. Pay attention to the unique characteristics of each planet type - from mineral-rich asteroids to heavily populated trade hubs - as understanding these will be crucial to your success. Remember, this is a game designed for deep strategic thinking, so take your time to learn the systems and experiment with different approaches!

                    Once you've mastered the basics, it's time to dive into the advanced strategies that separate good commanders from legendary ones. After Gate rewards strategic thinking and long-term planning. Learn to optimize your economy by establishing efficient trade routes between your controlled planets. Master the art of fleet composition - knowing when to deploy heavy battleships versus fast interceptors can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Utilize the terrain and planetary features to your advantage during battles. The technology tree is vast and offers multiple paths to victory - whether you focus on military might, economic supremacy, or diplomatic influence. Pay close attention to character abilities and synergies, as the right combination of commanders can provide devastating tactical advantages. Study your opponents' patterns and adapt your strategy accordingly. Remember to balance short-term tactical decisions with long-term strategic goals, and don't neglect espionage and intelligence gathering as tools in your arsenal!

                    Here are some expert tips that will help you dominate the After Gate universe. Always scout ahead before committing to major offensives - knowledge of enemy positions and strength is invaluable. Don't spread your forces too thin across too many planets; it's better to hold fewer planets securely than to lose them all to counterattacks. Invest in defensive structures early to protect your key economic planets. Use characters strategically - their special abilities can turn the tide of battle when used at the right moment. Pay attention to the storyline choices as they can unlock unique units and bonuses. Resource management is key - always maintain reserves for emergency situations. Join alliances when beneficial but be prepared to adapt if political situations change. Practice micro-management in smaller skirmishes to improve your combat effectiveness. Take advantage of planet-specific bonuses and build structures that complement them. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment with unconventional strategies - After Gate rewards creative thinking and bold decision-making!
